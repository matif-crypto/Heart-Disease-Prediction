# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
sklearn.model_selection
scikit-learn
sklearn.metrics
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook or google colab.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

Code
Template code is provided in the boston_housing.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the included visuals.py Python file and the heart_disease_data.csv dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in visuals.py is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file
